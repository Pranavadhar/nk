This project classifies consumer complaints into categories using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes) with TF-IDF vectorization.  
It preprocesses complaint text, trains models, evaluates accuracy, and provides a function for predicting categories on new complaints.  
Run `predict_category("Sample complaint text", "Logistic_Regression")` to classify a new complaint.
